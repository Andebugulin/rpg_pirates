### ⚓ Critical Combat Preparation 🗡️

**IMPORTANT: Weapon Equipping Guide**

Before engaging in naval battles, remember that simply picking up a weapon is not enough! To be combat-ready:

1. **Locate Weapon**: Find a weapon in your inventory during exploration
2. **Open Equipment Menu**: Press `E` during pre-combat screen
3. **Select and Equip**: Choose the weapon to move it from inventory to your active hand
4. **Verify Equipped Status**: Ensure weapon is highlighted or shows as active

**Pro Tip**: An unequipped weapon is just dead weight. Always equip before battle, or you'll be fighting with your bare hands! 🥊

*No weapon = No victory* 🏴‍☠️
